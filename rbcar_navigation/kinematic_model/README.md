This is the kinematic model for RBCAR/Polaris. 

It generate motion primitives for SBPL planner.

Scripts to generate primitives are ackermann.m and ackermann2.m

There is a problem when it is run with Octave in GUI mode, so run them in CLI mode:

octave-cli ackermann2.m > polaris_noback.mprim

Primitives are generated by simulating movement with a small timestep, and then downsampling.

Primitives must have the same spatial resolution as maps in move base.

If map is too big, then it may overflow.

EndPose of each primitive is expressed in terms of spatial resolution, not meters.

If primitives are not properly loaded by SBPL, then build your own version of SBPL and add comments, because SBPL is not so verbose.
